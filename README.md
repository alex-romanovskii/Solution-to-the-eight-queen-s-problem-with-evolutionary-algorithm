# Solution-to-the-eight-queen-s-problem-with-evolutionary-algorithm

General:  
The eight queen’s problem is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Goal:  
Solve the eight queen’s problem with genetic algorithm.

Tools:  
1) Programming language – Python.
2) Evolutionary computation framework – DEAP.
